This is an android app developed by me(Anshul Ganorkar). The app is also available on Google Play.

As an android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

This andorid app doesn't ask for any user permission.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
